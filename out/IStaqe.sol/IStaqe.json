contract implements a flexible staking system where users can stake ERC20 or ERC721 tokens in various pools to earn rewards in the form of ERC20 tokens. The contract supports the creation and  management of multiple staking pools, each with its own configuration for staked tokens and rewards. Users can stake and unstake their tokens at any time, subject to the rules of each pool, and claim their earned rewards after a specified number of blocks. The contract extends OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrant calls, and Context to provide information about the transaction's context. It implements the IStaqe interface, which defines the core functionality for staking, unstaking, reward management, and pool configuration. Key Features: - Create and manage multiple staking pools with different configurations. - Stake ERC20 or ERC721 tokens to participate in earning rewards. - Configure rewards in ERC20 tokens for each staking pool. - Claim rewards after a specified number of blocks, enforcing a minimum staking period. - Flexible design allowing for various staking and reward strategies.
